# SimCD: Simultaneous Clustering and Differential expression analysis for single-cell transcriptome data

**Sim**ultaneous **C**lustering and **D**ifferential (SimCD) is a unified Bayesian method based on a hierarchical gamma-negative binomial (hGNB) model, to simultaneously
perform clustering and differential expression analysis for single-cell RNA-seq data. SimCD is capable of including both gene- and cell-level biological explanatory variables
to better model scRNA-seq data and it also obviates the need for any sophisticated pre-processing step.
